# Distributed File Sorting

The application sorts numbers in a very large file. The file is divided into small parts in order to increase efficiency of sorting. Quick sort and merge sort algorithms are used for sorting numbers. The application simulates different computers that simultaneously run in a network and they communicates via UDP while sorting the numbers and dividing/merging files.
